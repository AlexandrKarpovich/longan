        .list__title 1. Letting internal teams focus on core projects
        .list__text The key to getting the most out of outsourced remote management is through finding the best balance of services across support areas, whether the need is for remote application management, database administration, or specialized functional support. Having a dedicated and reliable team will allow you to free internal resources to focus on more important projects.

        .list__title 2. Saving money by doing less and getting better results
        .list__text Cost savings is usually the most tangible benefits of offloading “chore” tasks to focus on “core” tasks. When you find the right outsourced team for remote database and application management, you typically will get more out of limited resources like on-demand access to senior-level experts, as you no longer have to spend the time or capital to find and hire that expert. That is also true of niche talent needed for a temporary service or task. Without the support of outsourced managed service providers, you would need to hire a consultant or add an employee in order to obtain this niche talent. But by right-sourcing in partnership with a managed service provider, you have access to the right person for the job whenever the need comes up.

        .list__title 3. Tapping into the best quality talent
        .list__text When right-sourcing to a qualified database and application managed services provider, another big advantage is that you gain access to a full team of industry experts in every aspect of IT. Especially for an IT team that is smaller and/or more limited in their resources (monitoring/management tools, consulting budgets, etc.), if your business takes care of “chore” tasks internally, it’s often too big of a burden,thereby limiting your ability to grow your team’s expertise. But if you outsource these tasks to a qualified managed service provider, you can either free your team to focus on more strategic activities and/or leverage the outsourced remote management team’s expertise and specialized knowledge to find solutions and improvements to your unique needs.
